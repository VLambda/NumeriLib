# Chapter 1: What is Mathematica

## 1.1 Overview

Welcome to the official documentation of the Mathematica Mathematics Library. This library is designed to provide a comprehensive set of mathematical functions for Rust programmers. Whether you are working on scientific computing, data analysis, or any other math-intensive project, this library aims to be your one-stop shop.

## 1.2 Work in Progress

As a testament to my commitment to continuous improvement, Mathematica is an ongoing project. I am constantly expanding and enhancing its capabilities, striving to provide a robust and comprehensive set of mathematical tools. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable in shaping the future of the library.

## 1.3 What is so far added?

### 1.3.1 Calculus

The Calculus branch of the library is section to various aspects of calculus, including differentiation, integration, and much, much more.

### 1.3.2 Special Functions

The Special Functions branch encompasses a range of essential mathematical functions, such as Gamma, Beta, and Polygamma functions, with more functions and others soon to be added.

### 1.3.3 Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is fundamental in various fields of mathematics and engineering. The Linear Algebra branch offers essential functionalities like matrix operations. Do note that Linear Algebra is much in the development phase and is not fully mature yet.

### 1.3.4 Statistics

Statistics is a major part of this library and assists in analysis for offering highly accurate calculations for distributions.
