The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse \(c\) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides \(a\) and \(b\). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[c^2 = a^2 + b^2\]

This equation shows the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.
